<h1>PredictMED - "Transforming Health with Precision Predictions"</h1>
<p>Idea: The idea is to develop a website that offers predictive health analytics for conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and brain cancer, while also providing nearby hospital and clinic information for emergency situations. The website aims to deliver accurate predictions using advanced algorithms, prioritize user security through robust authentication measures, and enhance user engagement with interactive features. Use Cases: Health Prediction: Users can input relevant health data (such as medical history, lifestyle habits, genetic information) into the website. The website uses machine learning models trained on medical data to predict the likelihood of developing diabetes, heart disease, or brain cancer based on the input data. Predictive analytics provide users with personalized insights and recommendations for preventive measures. Emergency Assistance: In case of emergency, users can quickly locate nearby hospitals and clinics using the website. Integration with GPS or location services helps identify the closest medical facilities. Contact information, emergency services availability, and directions are provided to ensure timely medical care. User Interaction and Engagement: The website includes interactive features such as chatbots or virtual assistants to guide users through the health prediction process and emergency procedures. Real-time feedback on health risks and emergency response times enhances user experience and trust. Tech Stack Used: REACT, TAILWIND CSS, HTML AND CSS, JAVASCRIPT, PYTHON, FLASK, MACHINE LEARNING, KERAS</p>
